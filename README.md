# Scholarship-Grant-App

## Overview

Welcome to the Scholarship Grant System! This assembly language project automates the scholarship allocation process for both administrators and students. The system includes features such as credential editing, student list viewing, budget overview for administrators, and scholarship status checking for students.

## How to Run

### Requirements

1. **Assembly Compiler:** Ensure you have an assembly language compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can use [MASM](https://www.masm32.com/download.htm) for Windows or [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) for Linux.

2. **Text Editor:** A text editor for viewing and copying the assembly code. You can use any text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asghar4415/scholarship-grant-app.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   cd scholarship-grant-app

3. **Copy the Code:**

Copy the entire code from main code.txt.

4. **Paste and Compile:**

Open your assembly language compiler.
Create a new file and paste the copied code.
Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., scholarship_system.asm).
Compile the code using the compiler's instructions.

5. **Run the Executable:**

After successful compilation, an executable file is generated.
Run the executable to start the Scholarship Grant System.
